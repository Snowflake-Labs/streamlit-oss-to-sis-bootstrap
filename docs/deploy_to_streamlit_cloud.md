# Deploying Your Streamlit App to Streamlit Cloud

# Deploying Your Streamlit App to Streamlit Cloud

Congratulations on setting up your project using the Stream Starter Kit! In this chapter, we'll take the next exciting step: deploying your bare-bones application to Streamlit Cloud. This will be the starting point of your application-building journey.

Streamlit Cloud is a platform that allows you to easily deploy, manage, and share your Streamlit applications with the world. By deploying your app to Streamlit Cloud, you'll be able to access it from anywhere, collaborate with others, and showcase your work to a wider audience.

In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:

- [x] Creating a Streamlit Cloud account
- [x] Preparing your app for deployment
- [x] Connecting your GitHub repository to Streamlit Cloud
- [x] Configuring your app settings on Streamlit Cloud
- [x] Deploying your app and accessing it via a public URL
- [x] Making updates to your app and watch application refresh automatically in few seconds

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a live, publicly accessible Streamlit app that serves as a foundation for your application-building exercises. You'll be able to share the URL with others, gather feedback, and iterate on your app as you progress through the tutorial.

Let's dive in and get your app deployed to Streamlit Cloud!

## Navigate to app folder

If you are not on `$TUTORIAL_HOME`, naviaget to it and open the project in VS Code,

```shell
cd $TUTORIAL_HOME
code .
```

## Update Python packages

!!!NOTE
    Making sure we use right package version that will allow us to deploy the same application to Snowflake in Streamlit(SiS) in the later module.

Update the `requirements.txt` to be like,

```requirements
snowflake-cli-labs>=3.1.0,<4.0.0
streamlit==1.35.0
pandas==2.0.3
numpy==1.24.3
scikit-learn==1.3.0
```

## Create Python Environment

We will use [`miniconda`](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) to create the Python environment and install all the packages.

Create an environment file `environment.yml` like,

```yaml
name: st_ml_app
channels:
  - snowflake
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.11
  - pip
  - pip:
    - -r requirements.txt
```

Run the following command to create the Python virtual environment,

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml 
```

And activate the environment,

```
conda activate st_ml_app
```

!!!TIP
    - Using [direnv](https://direnv.net) declutters your environment and you can create Python virtual environment with just one like `layout_python`

## Application Update

Let us start with a small change to the application code.

!!!NOTE
    For the entire tutorial we will making changes to the `streamlit_app.py` file, the code listing will show the entire source with the changes highlighted. This is avoid any copy/paste error while doing the exercises.

Edit and update the `streamlit_app.py`,

```py linenums="1"
import streamlit as st

st.title("ðŸ¤– Machine Learning App")

st.write("Welcome to world of Machine Learning with Streamlit.")
```

Commit and push the code your remote Github repository.

## Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud

To deploy the application naviagate to <https://streamlit.io>{:target=_blank}, Sign-In and click **Create app**.

You will need the following details for deploying the app,

- **GitHub Repo name** - `<your-gh-user>/st-ml-app`
- **Branch** - `master`
- **Main file path** - `streamlit_app.py`
- **App URL** - choose a public url for your application easiest one to avoid is to use something like `<your gh user>-ml-app`.

Any commit and push to your repository will trigger a new application update. **Give it a try!**

Great! Now that you have successfully deployed your bare-bones Streamlit app to Streamlit Cloud, you're ready to dive into the exciting world of building machine learning applications.

In the next chapter, we'll start transforming your starter app into a fully-fledged ML application.
